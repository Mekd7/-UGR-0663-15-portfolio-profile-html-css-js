            <h2>Poetry</h2>
            <p>Poetry is my creative playground! I revel in the dance of words, using them to express my thoughts and emotions. I also love immersing myself in poems that resonate deeply, letting their rhythms and meanings wash over me. Each verse is a new adventure, a delightful exploration of feelings and ideas!</p>

            <p>I would like to share one of my recent poetic creations with you.</p>

            <h2>Gathering With Friends</h2>
        <p>Spending quality time with my friends is another one of my favorite pastimes! Whether weâ€™re wandering around campus, exploring new restaurants, or diving into exciting events, time simply flies by without us even noticing. Each moment is filled with laughter and adventure, making every outing a cherished memory!</p>

            <h2>Coding</h2>
            <p>It's been a few years since I embarked on my journey as a software engineering student, and since then, my favorite activity has been sitting in cozy, quiet 'work from home' cafes and coding away!</p>
